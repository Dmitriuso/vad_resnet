## 1D-Resnet model that classifies whether a audio signal is speech or noise

### Quick start

Launch the command `bash run.sh` in order to run the pipeline with default parameters. It compises the following steps:

- Data download (LibriSpeech test-clean subset)
- Dependencies installation
- Data images creation
- Model training
- Inference on a test file in dataset/test_data

The visualization of the inference result will be placed into ./result folder.
